# Volume image alignment with render_log_dir

The design of the main window, where you control and run the alignment workflow is inspired by [IMOD's](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/) [`etomo`](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/etomoTutorial.html) main window showing the sequential main steps of the procedure in the menu column on the left and all important parameter settings belonging to the current active steps in the main page.
